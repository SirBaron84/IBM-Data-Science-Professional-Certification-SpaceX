## IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

### Business Scenario
This report is created as reference to predict if the Falcon 9 rocket of Space X first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. If can be determine of the first stage will land, a good estimation of what it cost to launch a Falcon 9 rocket can be made. This information can be used by an alternate company who wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

This capstone project course gives a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. Assum that I work as a Data Scientist  for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting the  results to stakeholders. The main task is predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

### Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. The unique selling point of SpaceX are the savings, because SpaceX reuses the first stage of a rocket. A accurate prediction of the likelihood that the first stage rocket will land successfully, will result in informed decision for the start up a advantage to make more bids against SpaceX rocket lauches.     

### Objectives
- Apply the data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood the the first stage rocket will launch and land successfully, and thus the cost of a launch can be determined.
- Explore the data in order to obtain more insight about SpaceX rockets and launches.

### Business metric
This report use different approaches to classify and predict accuracy. 
Classification accuracy is number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction.

Defined as: 
$$Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$

### Deliverables
- Data driven insights and the best accurate predictive algorithm.
- Business case report to stakeholders, see folder Week 5 for "Data_Science_Capstone_Project_Space_X_Final_Report.pptx"
